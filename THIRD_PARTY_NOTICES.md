* devbench.dll is a separate, optional program this mod only talks to through the DevBench consumer API.

## SKSE Menu Framework consumer header (include/SKSEMenuFramework.h)

From SKSE-Menu-Framework-3 (https://github.com/QTR-Modding/SKSE-Menu-Framework-3), copied 2026-08-24 while that repository was LGPL-2.1, modified to prefer the Apocrypha Menu Framework. LGPL-2.1, which permits its use in this GPL-3.0-or-later work. Copyright QTR-Modding and contributors. It only calls the menu framework's public exports by name; nothing is linked.
